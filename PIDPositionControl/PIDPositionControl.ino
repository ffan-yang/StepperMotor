/*
*			Example sketch for PID position control!
*
*	This example demonstrates how easy closed loop position control can be achieved using the uStepper !
*	The only thing needed to activate closed loop control, is in the stepper.setup() function, where the
*	object is initiated with the keyword "PID", followed by the microstepping setting, faultTolerance (in steps),
*	hysteresis (in steps) and the P, I and D coefficients. For more information, check out the documentation:
*	http://ustepper.com/docs/html/index.html
*
*	Once the PID is activated, the use of the library is the same as without the PID !
